### GunnerCommander

Gunner Commander is a game where you have 7 lanes, and you have to defend each lane from enemy who is trying to get to your fence and destroy your base. You and the enemy have money to deploy troops, but the enemy is always slightly stronger than you and has a little bit more money than you. BUT you have your GUNS! Show that you are a true commander by deploying troops and by finding the best strategies to defend your base while you upgrade your troops and guns.

#### Deploying
Here is a demonstration how to deploy troops

#### Guns
You start with pistol. While moving to level 6 you unlock AK-47 and at level 10 you get shotgun. 
You can upgrade these guns with upgrade money at the store. You can also unlock Desert Eagle, Bow, Bazooka and Machine Gun with upgrade money. Here are some feature about guns when you upgrade them to MAX.

#### Shop
In shop you can upgrade your guns, troops and fence, buy ammo, exchange your upgrade money to deployment money.

#### Pick Ups
When you kill an enemy troop you receive deploy money, and they have a chance to drop a money stack by clicking it with your right mouse button, you can pick it up. At level 1 you start with pistol all the way to level 6 where you get AK-47. In this round, enemy will start to drop also ammo boxes. What gun you are using at that time to pick it will register in that gun

#### Settings
In settings, you can turn full screen ON or OFF, change the resolutions (resolutions work the way that it will check what your monitor or TV supports) and you can adjust music volume or game volume.

#### Game Over
This is where it ends. You fought well commander.
