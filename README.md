### GunnerCommander

Gunner Commander is a game where you have 7 lanes, and you have to defend each lane from enemy who is trying to get to your fence and destroy your base. You and the enemy have money to deploy troops, but the enemy is always slightly stronger than you and has a little bit more money than you. BUT you have your GUNS! Show that you are a true commander by deploying troops and by finding the best strategies to defend your base while you upgrade your troops and guns.

### Instruction
Quick walkthrough. You choose your lane with W (up) and S (down). On the left top corner, you have your troops. You choose them with A (left) and D (right) and press space to deploy them. You start with 5 troop, and you can buy with upgrade money more troops to fight alongside you.
